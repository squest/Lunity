Stupid attempt to make Clojure/Haskell functions available in Common Lisp

### Usage

simply (load "clojure.lisp") and/or (load "haskell.lisp")

### Rationale

Clojure and Haskell are beautiful languages, and CL is my personal "heritage" language.  
I want to code in CL but added with some modern features, hence this repo.  
Not so much an implementation of both languages on CL, simply made the superficial attempt  
so that I can call things like range, iterate, comp, juxt, etc.

Also, I added some common mathematical functions.

### Here are the list of functions that already implemented:
